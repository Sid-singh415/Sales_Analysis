## 📈 Key Insights

Here are some key business insights extracted from the sales dashboard:

- **Top Performing Region**:  
  The **West region** consistently led in total sales and had the highest number of units sold across all quarters.

- **Best-Selling Category**:  
  The **Technology** category generated the most revenue, with **Phones and Accessories** being the most profitable sub-categories.

- **Sales Trend Over Time**:  
  Sales peaked in the **4th quarter**, indicating a possible seasonal pattern or successful end-of-year promotions.

- **Underperforming Segments**:  
  The **Home Office** customer segment had significantly lower sales compared to **Corporate** and **Consumer** segments.

- **Profitability vs Quantity Sold**:  
  Some regions sold more units but didn't generate proportionate profit — indicating a need to assess **pricing strategy** or **discount policies**.

- **Shipping Mode Impact**:  
  **Standard Class** was the most commonly used shipping mode, but **Second Class** deliveries showed slightly higher profitability.

These insights can help stakeholders focus on high-performing regions, optimize product-category strategies, and identify areas for cost reduction or targeted marketing.
